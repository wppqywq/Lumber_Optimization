# Cutting Patterns Optimization

This project aims to optimize the order of cutting patterns to minimize the table length required during the cutting process. The optimization algorithm employed is Simulated Annealing (SA). 

The project repository consists of a Jupyter Notebook file (`code.ipynb`) that contains the code, data, and results. 

A separate file (`CodeExplaination.pdf`) provides a comprehensive explanation of the algorithm, mathematical formulations, and analyses and discussion of the results.
